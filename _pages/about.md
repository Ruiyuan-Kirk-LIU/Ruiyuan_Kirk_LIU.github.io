Hi! I am Ruiyuan. Welcome to my page!

I am a PhD student at [Graduate School of Frontier Sciences](https://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) specializing in coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis.

I am supervised by [Dr. Shinichiro Maruyama](https://www.ib.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/faculty/integrated_biology/maruyama_shinichiro/) of the [Laboratory of Integrated Biology](https://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/matsunaga_lab/index.html). I received my bachelor's degree in Marine Resources and Environment (advisor: [Dr. Jingyu Li](https://scxy.ouc.edu.cn/zlxyzlyzyjs/list.htm)) from the Ocean University of China in 2020. Then, I worked as a research assistant at the [Chloroplast Systems and Synthetic Biology Laboratory](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/xiaobo-li.html), Westlake University. Before coming to UTokyo, I obtained a master's degree in Applied Marine Biology (advisor: [Dr. Masakazu Aoki](https://sites.google.com/view/tohoku-marine-plant-ecology/%E3%83%9B%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0?authuser=0)) from Tohoku University in 2022.

**My academic interests mainly lie in:**  
路 Diversity of coral symbiotic algae  
路 Phototaxis of zooxanthellae and its effects on symbiosis establishment  
路 Signal transduction and immune mechanisms between symbiont algae and cnidarian hosts  
路 How coral-algal symbioses adapt and acclimate to global climate and environmental changes  

My non-academic interests are _Diving_ and _Hiking_. I find joy in the unique scenery of these trips, and the beauty of nature profoundly inspires my research.
